# MSDS-692--Practicum-1

The main project file for my final project is under Lujan_P1 which stands for Lujan Practicum 1. My project was an MLB analysis of power hitters and creating a classification system for them and predicting team wins based on other statistics. For I used two datasets from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/open-source-sports/baseball-databank

These were, the batting and team CSV files available there. My process is listed below:

* Problem identification
* Data Cleaning
* EDA
* Data Visualization
* Model building/optimization
* Comparison with other models
* Conclusion/Findings

Most of the techniques used in this project came from the MSDS 680 Machine Learning course at Regis University. However, the use of the plotly package was learned while in MSDS 670- Data Visualization. This project was an application of skills and processes learned in those classes on an area of interest for myself. For further explanation, I've included a powerpoint presentation that explains my findings along with the video presentation under the file Lujan_MLB.mp4. That should be available to download.
